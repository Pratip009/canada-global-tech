    question: "What is user research?",
    answer:
      "User research is integral to creating a user experience design. It leverages different research methodologies to research the needs, wants, pain points, behavior, aptitude, etc of users. This process is known as user research. We leverage the insights gathered to refine our software solutions and increase user acceptability. ",

  {
    question: "Is user research the same thing as user testing?",
    answer: `we offer both services, but they are very different processes. However, both aim to achieve the same thing: to make the software useful for the user and ensure they can use it without suffering any hassle. 

User testing involves testing a developed solution for errors and glitches that can impact user experience. User research gathers relevant insights that help designers and planners integrate required features and functionalities that can enhance user experience by eliminating their pain points. Both are integral parts of software development and help elevate software quality.`,
